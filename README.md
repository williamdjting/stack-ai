Installation, Environment & Scripts

Before starting, make sure you have the latest version of Node.js and npm installed. You can follow this guide to update both: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-update-node-and-npm-to-the-latest-version/

To set up StackUp AI locally, first clone the repository using: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stackup-ai.git
Then navigate into the directory with: cd stackup-ai

Next, install all dependencies using: npm install

Once the installation is complete, start the development server by running: npm run dev

After that, open your browser and go to: http://localhost:3000/dashboard to view the app locally.

If your project requires environment variables, create a file named .env.local in the root directory and add the following lines:
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key

You can use these scripts for common tasks:
- npm run dev → Start the app in development mode
- npm run build → Build the production bundle
- npm start → Start the production server
- npm run lint → Run lint checks for code quality

Deployment

The project is optimized for deployment on Vercel. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel, add your environment variables under “Project Settings → Environment Variables,” and deploy. Vercel will automatically detect and build the Next.js configuration.
